# Task Manager App

This is a simple task management application built with React Native. It allows users to create, complete, and delete tasks. Each task can be expanded to view the full description.

## Features

- **Create tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Complete tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks are visually distinct from incomplete tasks.
- **Delete tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Expand/Collapse tasks**: Users can expand tasks to view the full description and collapse them back to a single line.

## Setup and Running

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.

First, ensure you have Expo CLI installed globally on your system:

```sh
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## Clone this repository

Clone the repository to start setting up the Task Manager App on your local machine.

## Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
cd TaskManagerApp
npm install
```

Alternatively, if you're using Yarn, use the following command:

## Development

This app was developed using the following key technologies:

- **React Native**: A robust framework for building native apps using React.
- **Expo**: A versatile platform for universal React applications.

No third-party libraries were utilized beyond the comprehensive suite of tools provided by Expo.

## Testing

For testing purposes, the app can be run on both Android and iOS platforms by using the Expo Go app, available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. This allows for a seamless testing experience across different devices.
